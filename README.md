   ```

2. (Optional but recommended) create and activate a virtual environment.

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the backend server (default on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`):

   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   ```

### 2. Frontend (React + Vite)
